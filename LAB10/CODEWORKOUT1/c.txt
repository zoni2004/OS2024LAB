The `sleep()` function in the producer and consumer threads serves two key purposes. First, it simulates real-world processing delays, making the program behave more like an actual system where producing and consuming items takes time. By adding random pauses (`sleep(rand() % 3)`), the threads operate at unpredictable speeds, which better tests the synchronization logic. Second, it prevents CPU overuse by yielding execution periodically, ensuring the program doesn’t monopolize system resources while still demonstrating the producer-consumer interaction clearly.  

Additionally, `sleep()` makes the program’s behavior easier to observe. Without delays, the threads would run too quickly to see how they interact with the buffer and semaphores. The pauses allow you to watch the producer fill the buffer and the consumer empty it in a controlled, visible manner, highlighting the importance of the `full` and `empty` semaphores in managing the buffer’s capacity. This makes the synchronization mechanics more apparent and the simulation more practical for learning.
